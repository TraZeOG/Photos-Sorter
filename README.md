A small script that can help you sort your photos in different appropriate folders

to use it, just place the photos you wanna sort in a "Photos tri√©es" folder (ik it's French booo berk), this folder being in your pictures folder.

reach me to report any bugs or to suggest any feature I could add


# Caution

use with caution, always keep a save of your photos before running the script !
normally there is no problem but hey I really don't wanna be responsible for anything bad happening to anyone
